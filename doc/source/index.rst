Khard is an address book for the Unix command line.  It can read, create,
modify and delete carddav address book entries.  Khard only works with a local
store of VCARD files.  It is intended to be used in conjunction with other
programs like an email client, text editor, vdir synchronizer or VOIP client.


Installation
============

.. image:: https://repology.org/badge/tiny-repos/khard.svg
   :target: https://repology.org/project/khard/versions
   :alt: Packaging status

Khard is available as a native package for some \*nix distributions so you
should check your package manager first.  If you want or need to install
manually you can use the release from `PyPi`_:

.. code-block:: shell

  pip3 install khard

If you want to help the development or need more advanced installation
instructions see :doc:`contributing`.

If you need a tarball use the one from `PyPi`_ and not from the Github release
page.  These are missing an auto generated python file.

.. _PyPi: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/khard/

Configuration
=============

The configuration file of khard is stored in the XDG conform config directory.
If the environment variable ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` is set, it is
``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/khard/khard.conf`` and it defaults to
``~/.config/khard/khard.conf`` otherwise.

An :download:`example configuration <examples/khard.conf.example>` is provided
in the source tree.  It looks like this:

.. literalinclude:: examples/khard.conf.example
   :language: ini
