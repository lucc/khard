Subcommands
-----------

The functionality of khard is divided into several subcommands.  All of these
have their own help text which can be seen with ``khard SUBCOMMAND --help``.

Many subcommands accept search terms to limit the number of contacts they
should work on, display or present for selection.  The syntax is described in
:ref:`Search query syntax`.

Search query syntax
-------------------

Search queries consist of one or more command line arguments.  Each can be a
simple search term or a search term for a specific field.  The field name is
separated from the search term by a colon (``:``) without any spaces.

Spaces in the field name have to be replaced with underscores.

The available fields are the same fields as in the YAML template with the
exception of the five name components (first, last, prefix, suffix,
additional).  But there is the special pseudo field specifier ``name:`` which
will search in *any* name related field (including nichnames and formatted
names).

If a field name is not known the search term is interpreted as a plain search
term and the string (including the colon) is looked up in any field of the
contact.

Configuration
-------------

See :manpage:`khard.conf(5)`.
